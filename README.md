# Motivation
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

# Requirements
The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character type:

  * Special characters

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters

The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts.

The user should also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.

The application should have a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
